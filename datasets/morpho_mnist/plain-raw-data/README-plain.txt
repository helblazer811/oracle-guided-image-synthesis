Morpho-MNIST: Plain dataset
===========================

This dataset corresponds to upsampled, binarised, then downsampled MNIST digits,
with no perturbations. It consists of the following files:

- [train|t10k]-images-idx3-ubyte.gz: images
- [train|t10k]-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz: digit labels, copied from original MNIST
- [train|t10k]-morpho.csv: morphometrics table, with columns:
    - 'index': index of the corresponding digit (for convenience, although rows
      are written in order)
    - 'area' (pxÂ²), 'length' (px), 'thickness' (px), 'slant' (rad), 'width'
      (px), 'height' (px): calculated morphometrics

As in the original MNIST, 'train' and 't10k' refer to the 60,000 training and
10,000 test samples, respectively. The data is distributed in the same format
(IDX-encoded uint8 arrays), described in http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.
